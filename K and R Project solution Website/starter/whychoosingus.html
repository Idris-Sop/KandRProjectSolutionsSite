                                        <p>Social distancing does not mean we cannot stay connected with our virtual interpreters in Africa.
                                           Social distancing and remote work are essential to global efforts to combat the pandemic, leading to a shift from physical meetings to safer, more flexible online environments. Many commercial enterprises, private organisations, and NGOs in South Africa use virtual conferencing platforms such as Teams, Google Meet, Skype, and Zoom. K & R Project Solutions can facilitate web-based software, supported by UN-standard professional interpreters with specialised subject knowledge, to provide online simultaneous interpretation for your delegates worldwide. We possess the expertise to deliver accurate, experienced, and accessible simultaneous interpreting solutions for virtual meetings.</p>
